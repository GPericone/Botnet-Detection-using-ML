# Tackling the Botnets

This repository contains the notebooks and presentation file for the project "Tackling the botnets", developed as part of the Artificial Intelligence for Cybersecurity examination in the Master's Degree in Cybersecurity at the University of Pisa.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to create a machine learning model for botnet detection. Botnets are networks of compromised computers controlled by malicious actors to carry out various cyber attacks. Detecting botnets is crucial for maintaining the security of computer systems and networks.

## Files Included

- Notebooks: The notebook files provide a detailed explanation of the data preprocessing, classification, and evaluation steps undertaken to build the botnet detection model.
- Presentation: The presentation file contains a concise overview of the project, including the problem statement, methodology and results.

## Usage Instructions

To replicate or build upon our work, follow these steps:

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Install the necessary dependencies and libraries as mentioned in the notebook.
- Open the notebook file using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
- Execute the cells in sequential order to reproduce the results and evaluate the model.
- Refer to the presentation file for a summarized overview of the project and key findings.
